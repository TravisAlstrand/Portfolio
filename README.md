# 💻 Travis Alstrand - Developer Portfolio

## 👋 About Me

I'm a web developer with certifications in front-end, full-stack JavaScript, Python, data analysis, and Java. Since 2021, I've been building my skills through hands-on projects and by teaching hundreds of students to code at [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/). That teaching experience sharpened both my technical and communication skills, and I'm now focused on applying my expertise in real-world development projects.
